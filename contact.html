        <p>The average family in  about two hours in the evening managing their afterschool activities. That means there could be very little time to cook at home. Because the fast food industry is available in almost every community, you have the option to manage your schedule without going hungry in the process. Choosing a meal like this takes 50% less time than it would if you were to try to make lunch or dinner at home. It may not seem like much, but 15-30 extra minutes in a tight schedule can be quite valuable.</p>
